      Thank you, Mr. Khairiddin for teaching us. <br />During one week you
      showed and tought us how to create some tables, <br />
      how to put audios, videos, images and etc. <br />
      <span>We appreciate you.</span> <br />
      <h1 id="second">
        The result of first week was this small project, of course it's just a
        beginning of HTML and CSS'S road, <br />
        but we really hope that we will be able to do the real magic things.
        <br />
        Of course we will try hard otherwise we will end up getting lost out of
        here.
