    <h1>GRAND THEFT AUTO</h1>
   <b><p>
    Grand Theft Auto is an action-adventure video game developed by DMA Design
    and published by BMG Interactive. It is the first title of the Grand Theft
    Auto series and was released in November 1997 for MS-DOS and Microsoft
    Windows, in December 1997 for the PlayStation and in October 1999 for the
    Game Boy Color. The game's narrative follows a criminal who climbs in
    status within the criminal underworld across three fictional cities,
    inspired by real-life locations. The gameplay is presented from a top-down
    perspective and takes place within an open-world environment in which the
    player is not required to perform missions, although they are necessary to
    progress through the levels.

        Grand Theft Auto is made up of six levels split between three main cities;
        each locale is based on a real-life city in the United States, with an
        alternative name: Liberty City (New York City), San Andreas (San
        Francisco), and Vice City (Miami). The progression is linear, as each
        level completed automatically unlocks the next one in the chain. Players
        begin a game choosing a character from amongst eight—four in the
        PlayStation version—and naming them, though the choice is purely
        aesthetic, and doesn't affect the overall gameplay. In each level, the
        player's ultimate objective is to reach a target number of points, which
        starts at $1,000,000 but becomes higher in the later levels, and then
        reach the level's "goal" to complete the stage. The player is free to do
        whatever they want, but have limited lives upon doing so. Points can
        be gained from anything, such as causing death and destruction amid the
        traffic in the city, completing special challenges, or stealing and
        selling cars for profit. However, the more typical means to achieve their
        target is to perform tasks for the level's local crime syndicate. Jobs can
        be initiated by visiting and touching a ringing telephone box, with each
        level's set of jobs on offer being unique.
