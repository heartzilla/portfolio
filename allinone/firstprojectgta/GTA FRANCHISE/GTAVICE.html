        Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is a 2002 action-adventure game developed by
        Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the fourth main
        entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2001's Grand Theft Auto
        III, and the sixth instalment overall. Set in 1986 within the fictional
        Vice City (based on Miami and Miami Beach), the single-player story
        follows mobster Tommy Vercetti's rise to power after being released from
        prison and becoming caught up in an ambushed drug deal. While seeking
        out those responsible, he slowly builds a criminal empire by seizing
        power from other criminal organisations in the city.

        Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is an action-adventure game played from a
        third-person perspective. The player controls criminal Tommy Vercetti
        and completes missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress
        through the story. It is possible to have several missions available at
        a time, as some missions require the player to wait for further
        instructions or events. Outside of missions, the player can freely roam
        the game's open world and has the ability to complete optional side
        missions.[3] Composed of two main islands and several smaller areas, the
        world is much larger in area than earlier entries in the series.     The
        islands are unlocked for the player as the story progresses.
