        Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a 2004 action-adventure game developed
        by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the fifth main
        entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2002's Grand Theft Auto:
        Vice City, and the seventh installment overall. It was released in
        October 2004 for the PlayStation 2, in June 2005 for Microsoft Windows
        and Xbox, and in November 2010 for Mac OS X. The game is set within an
        open world environment that players can explore and interact with at
        their leisure. The story follows former gangster Carl "CJ" Johnson, who
        returns home following his mother's murder and is drawn back into his
        former gang and a life of crime while clashing with corrupt authorities
        and powerful criminals. Carl's journey takes him across the fictional
        U.S. state of San Andreas, which is heavily based on California and
        Nevada and encompasses three major cities: Los Santos (inspired by Los
        Angeles), San Fierro (San Francisco) and Las Venturas (Las Vegas).

        Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is an action-adventure game with
        role-playing and stealth elements. Structured similarly to the previous
        two games in the series, the core gameplay consists of elements of
        third-person shooter and driving games, affording the player a large,
        open-world environment in which to move around. On foot, the player's
        character is capable of walking, running, sprinting, swimming, climbing,
        and jumping as well as using weapons and various forms of hand-to-hand
        combat. The player can operate a variety of vehicles, including
        automobiles, buses, semis, boats, fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters,
        trains, tanks, motorcycles, and bicycles. The player may also import
        vehicles in addition to stealing them.
