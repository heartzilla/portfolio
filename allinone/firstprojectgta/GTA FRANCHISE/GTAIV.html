        Grand Theft Auto IV is a 2008 action-adventure game developed by
        Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the sixth main
        entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2004's Grand Theft Auto:
        San Andreas, and the eleventh instalment overall. Set within the
        fictional Liberty City, based on New York City, the single-player story
        follows Eastern European war veteran Niko Bellic and his attempts to
        escape his past while under pressure from high-profile criminals. The
        open world design lets players freely roam Liberty City, consisting of
        three main islands, and the neighbouring state of Alderney, which is
        based on New Jersey.

        Grand Theft Auto IV is an action-adventure game played from a
        third-person perspective. Players complete missions—linear scenarios
        with set objectives—to progress through the story. It is possible to
        have several active missions running at one time, as some require
        players to wait for further instructions or events. Outside of missions,
        players can freely roam the game's open world and complete optional side
        missions. Composed of the fictional city of Liberty City, the world
        is larger in area than most earlier Grand Theft Auto series entries.
        At the beginning of the game, players can only explore the first
        island—composed of Dukes and Broker—with all other islands unlocking as
        the story progresses.
