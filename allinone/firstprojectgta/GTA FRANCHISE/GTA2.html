        Grand Theft Auto 2 is an action-adventure game, developed by DMA Design
        and published by Rockstar Games, for Microsoft Windows and the
        PlayStation in October 1999, and the Dreamcast and Game Boy Color in
        2000. It is the sequel to 1997's Grand Theft Auto, and the second main
        instalment of the Grand Theft Auto series. Set within a retrofuturistic
        metropolis known as "Anywhere City", the game focuses on players taking
        the role of a criminal as they roam an open world, conducting jobs for
        various crime syndicates and having free rein to do whatever they wish
        to achieve their goal. The game's intro is unique for a title in the
        series, as it involved live-action scenes filmed by Rockstar Games.

        The game was developed with an eight-minute short film of live-action
        footage, filmed within New York City. The movie was devised as an
        introductory sequence for the game, and was made available on Rockstar
        Games's website. The film follows a criminal named Claude Speed (played
        by Scott Maslen), who conducts jobs around Anywhere City for several
        criminal syndicates, until his actions eventually catch up and he is
        killed by an assassin from one of the gangs he robbed. The film was
        based on a screenplay by Dan Houser, and directed by Alex De
        Rakoff.
