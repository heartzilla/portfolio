        Grand Theft Auto III is a 2001 action-adventure game developed by DMA
        Design and published by Rockstar Games. It is the third main entry in
        the Grand Theft Auto series, following 1999's Grand Theft Auto 2, and
        the fifth instalment overall. Set within the fictional Liberty City
        (loosely based on New York City), the story follows Claude, a silent
        protagonist who, after being betrayed and left for dead by his
        girlfriend during a robbery, embarks on a quest for revenge that leads
        him to become entangled in a world of crime, drugs, gang warfare, and
        corruption. The game is played from a third-person perspective and its
        world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. Its open world design lets
        players freely roam Liberty City, consisting of three main areas.

        Grand Theft Auto III is an action-adventure game played from a
        third-person perspective. Players complete missions—linear scenarios
        with set objectives—to progress through the story. It is possible to
        have several missions available at a time, as some missions require
        players to wait for further instructions or events. Outside of
        missions, players can freely roam the game's open world, and have the
        ability to complete optional side missions. Liberty City is composed of
        three boroughs: Portland, Staunton Island, and Shoreside Vale; the
        latter two areas become unlocked as the player progresses through the
        storyline.
